1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening everyone.	

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Good evening everyone,
welcome to Ignite Taipei 2.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,900
I am really honored to see
so many people here tonight.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Before we begin,

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,200
I would like to demonstrate an Ignite talk

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
to let everyone know what Ignite is.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,359
Letâ€™s go!

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,000
I am your host tonight, Tifi.

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,100
I am English major at the Fu Jen University.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
Nice to meet you all

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Now allow me to introduce you Ignite Taipei


12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,700
First, our slogan is:

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Enlighten us, but make it quick.

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,000
We want to be inspired instantly.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,300
If anyone is not familiar with the word 'ignite'
It means to set something on fire

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
We want to light up our inspiration instantly

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,600
Many people have asked me
What is the difference between Ignite and TED?

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't they both host many lectures?
Are the lectures different?

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,200
Are the lectures different?

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Well, does anyone not heard of TED?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,300
The first difference is time control.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,000
An Ignite talk has only 5 minutes.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,900
With 20 Powerpoint slides

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Each auto-advance in 15 seconds

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,000
So it only takes one evening to host an Ignite event

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,800
All the many talks will fit into one evening

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,100
No matter you like it or want to fall asleep

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
5 minutes will past fast

29
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
If you like the lectures

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Please make good use of the 5 minutes

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not much

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,500
The second difference is speakers.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,700
Does anybody not know who this person is?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Who doesn't know?

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,500
He is Steve Jobs, founder of Apple.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,300
And the person on the right? Anonymous. 

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,600
What I want to say is,
Everybody can be a speaker at Ignite.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
If you are interested in sharing

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
You can come up here and speak.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Even for Steve Jobs would get just 5 minutes

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
The third difference, topics.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,000
TED focuses mainly on technology, entertainment and design

43
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,000
All those three topics.

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,200
But Ignite welcomes all kinds of topics

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Any topic,

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,000
such as, how to perform well on tests,

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,300
or how to communicate more efficiently

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
Whatever you like

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,700
So Ignite Taipei wants to enlighten people

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,700
To inspire people in life

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,500
From things they have not expected or experienced before

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,500
To inspire you through the talks

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,000
We organized Ignite in Taipei because...

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,900
Anybody have an idea?

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,600
Okay, I'll tell you.

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,000
First, we want drinks.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,100
We think people who like beer or coke
Are those who like the relaxed atmosphere

58
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,700
We can have fun and be happy

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,800
And attend the event with a good mood

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Second, we welcome people from everywhere. 

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
We want you to join us

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,500
Regardless of your age, gender or background 

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,300
We give you something if you show up tonight

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Third, we want to create connections. 

65
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,600
At Ignite, you meet people from different walks of life. 

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,700
You brainstorm together and create new thoughts

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,700
Thus the connections are formed

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
And we can get to know more people 

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,700
Last, Ignite Taipei is special because 
We have both English and Chinese versions 

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
We had Ignite Taipei 1 in English this June

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Ignite Taipei 2 in Chinese

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,200
And the coming up Ignite Taipei 3 in English this December 

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,700
We will host Ignite events constantly in the future

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,600
The next ignite will be in English,
and I hope you all will attend that as well!

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Besides Ignite Taipei, there's also
Ignite Seattle, Ignite Singapore...

76
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,000
Ignite is everywhere

77
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:22,700
So you have a lot of opportunities to see Ignite

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Before we start, I would like to remind you
to switch your phones to silent

79
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,000
And to speak at low volume 

80
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,700
Please follow the above two requirements

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,500
And, please watch your little matches

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Once you hear something interesting

83
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
or something new

84
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
Light them up

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,000
To have a flame, and make it into a big fire

86
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
You can contact us by this email address

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,900
If you are interested in being a speaker to share

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,300
Send us an email

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
And we also welcome your advice

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,300
So, nice meeting you all tonight

91
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,400
We are the organizers tonight

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,373
Thank you for coming, have a great night! 
Thank you!
