so um...

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,240
before i get my talk i would like to
remind all of you that we are very

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,000
special because we all are and five p

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
where not only the at the we have m_i_t_
because each opposes

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,770
most important person epithets

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,750
one of their most important person as
because uh... each of us has a magnified

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,170
in hand so

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,600
and even some of us have more so i a m
the magnifiers enables us to uh...

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,260
seeking think very detailed and very
curious about

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,159
everything on this planet

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,650
celeron

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,420
weeknight urs have very curious to know
we have the night at magnifier

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,090
and then we are looking for a new ideas
in this year

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,520
and then so

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,390
so

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,560
and so when we had the magnifier we look
for ideas so weak matters have

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,810
passionate supreme your ideas and then

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,480
once the new ideas recreate something
new ourselves

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,639
so

29
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:53,599
we were hungry for something and then we
get for thank just and then we create

30
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,390
something you are

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,130
so retailers have very

32
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,010
we have a lot of innovations and then we
have new ideas and then

33
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,840
once we have those in hands we are

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,869
passionate to share

35
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:07,980
so

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,910
passing makes is very important person
so and so what you guys you fall in

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,309
tickets hot at ignites happy like to
make

38
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,129
and then so

39
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,640
no even into a hard time tonight in
deeply and i commend with volunteer

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,309
again the next experience

41
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,510
so i like to remind all of you that

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,409
places like this little green belt where
all m_i_t_ it matters

43
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,799
and then sell maybe uh... so what is the
difference what are the differences

44
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,209
between we did not his and

45
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,959
teddy bears from texas

46
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,830
so tak well since we are we both get
free talks to the world so

47
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,409
one meets the biggest difference the
entertainers is that uh...

48
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,949
is that um... we ourselves

49
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,510
a big difference because not only by
some

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,609
remarkable people to talk and the like
defeated in the world class

51
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:02,909
well here at nights i'm nothing with
small class time

52
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,609
ignite allows anyone who hasn't idea
tata

53
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,709
so

54
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,439
that's the teddy bear and witness
professor tough

55
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,749
so uh... i think the second difference
that makes this different as p m

56
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,650
the language as the years

57
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,419
so um...

58
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,639
issue of caroline in your life she
contact event the instantaneous buffet

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,769
in english they only have spent for
other languages but

60
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,519
mostly they use interest

61
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,729
but here we are all fairy tale lucky
because in ignites heavy here we have

62
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,519
them

63
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,209
bug interest in chinese

64
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,500
so it is ferry create that we can
actually there is something else you

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,079
different languages that's very frankly

66
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,129
and so and the last day of friends
inputting anne's

67
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,109
with b

68
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,699
format sas we all know

69
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,069
aid tax teddy bear as allowed to speak
for eighteen minutes and it's quite

70
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,899
stunning too because they have to
manually controlled his life and then

71
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:06,859
so i had nothing for the audience at the
same time fact here at night we found

72
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,129
out that we have

73
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,789
twenty slides

74
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,329
fifteen-second out anthony slide and
then in total it adds up to you on the

75
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,669
five minutes so industrial in five
minutes

76
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:22,019
a concert but we still do you make a
difference in the world

77
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,949
so for example here

78
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,570
map of my cock

79
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,800
analogy here at the sixteen th

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,399
like sewing is nothing too much to go so
i a m

81
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,909
and by the way has another trick i can't
eat you guys to if you really have

82
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,069
enough to stay

83
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,460
and fifteen seconds is not enough for
you

84
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,840
soon this year

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,909
and then you copy and paste

86
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:47,809
several you make this thing al you make
the same flight i've hyphen and so as

87
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:48,979
you can see

88
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,510
this map is staying here

89
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,859
for let alone surface electric

90
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,809
so am these are the parts hopping to
have today so we have drake's decreased

91
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,240
introduces us to introduces arts

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,370
but senators

93
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,270
travel and finally drinks

94
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,490
so and this is your first again talk
tonight and

95
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,559
now it's starting to come on stage in my
tennis

96
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,689
and remember we all have to have fun
tonight paint chip
