00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,200
Hello and good evening everyone.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Welcome to Ignite Taipei event three tonight.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,500
So I'm your host tonight, Amber.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,200
I'm glad to meet you all today.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
[so, Greg, could you please]

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,500
Alright, so...

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm here today because I got a call from Tifi last week,

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,720
she invited me to be here today,
so I'm hosting this event today.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,700
So I've always wanted to come to the Ignite
and see what this event is for.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,600
So I really want to see mysterious people, like you guys,

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,059
and then the mysterious ideas you've got for us.

12
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,590
So um...

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,200
Before my talk I would like to remind all of you

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,950
that we are very special, because we all are MIP.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:01,500
Where not only VIP, we are MIP, because
each of us is most important person.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,100
Why we are most important persons is because

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,120
each of us has a magnifier in hand

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,550
and even some of us have more,
so the magnifier enables us to

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,100
to see things in gooder detail,
and we are very curious about

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
everything on this planet.

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,600
So...

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,370
We Igniters are very curious, so we have Ignite... magnifier...

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,040
and then we are looking for a new ideas on this Earth.

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,470
And then so...

25
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,340
So...

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,500
And so when we had the magnifier we look for ideas,

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,760
so we Igniters are passionate to find new ideas and then

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,430
Once we have new ideas, we create something new, ourselves.

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,589
So...

30
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,500
We were hungry for something and then we get full, we digest

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,340
and then we create something new on our own.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,080
So we Igniters are very...

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,960
We have a lot of innovations
and then we have new ideas and then

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,819
once we have those in hands we are passionate to share

35
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,930
so

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,700
Passion makes us very important person, so...

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,259
So like you guys, you volunteered
to talk at Ignite Taipei, like tonight.

38
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,700
And then so, if we enjoy our time tonight, and if we like,

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,259
then we volunteer again at the next event.

40
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,400
So i like to remind all of you that

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,359
we are just like this little green doll, we are all MIP Igniters.

42
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,749
and then so maybe... so what is the
difference, what are the differences

43
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,909
between we Igniters and teddy bears from TED.

44
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,780
So TED, well since we are, we both give
free talks to the world so

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,359
what makes the biggest difference between us is that TED...

46
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,500
is that um... we ourselves make a big difference

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
because TED only invites some remarkable people to talk

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,559
and they're like big figures in the world, but

49
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,859
well here at Ignite, I'm not saying we are small but

50
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,559
Ignite allows anyone who has an idea to talk.

51
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:08,659
so

52
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,389
That's the teddy bear and we Igniters are very special.

53
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,700
So uh... I think the second difference

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,600
that makes this different is the languages we use.

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,369
So um...

56
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:25,800
If you go online and you watch TED event videos

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,293
then you hear people talk in English,

58
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,099
they only have subtitles for other languages,

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,469
but mostly they use English.

60
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,039
but here we are all very very lucky,

61
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,235
because in Ignites happening here, we have

62
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:39,158
both English and Chinese.

63
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:43,100
so it is very great that we can actually learn something

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,029
in two different languages that's very very great!

65
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:52,600
and so the last difference inbetween us would be: format.

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,500
As we all know a TED teddy bear is allowed
to speak for eighteen minutes,

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,100
and it's quite challenging because
they have to manually control the slides,

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,400
and then try hard not to bore the audience at the same time.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,200
But here, Ignite, we all know that we have twenty slides

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,700
and fifteen second autoadvance on each slide,

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,300
then in total it adds up to five minutes.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
So those golden five minutes,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,969
it's, quite short, but we still do
make a difference in the world.

74
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,520
So for example here, this is the map of my talk.

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,349
I'm now here at the sixteenth slide,
so is nothing too much to go.

76
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,900
And by the way here's a little trick I can teach you guys.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So if you really have a lot to say,

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,100
and fifteen seconds is not enough for you,

79
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,790
you have so much to share,

80
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,859
and then you copy and paste.

81
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,100
So you make the same... you make the same slide twice,

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,929
and so, as you can see,

83
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,400
this map is staying here for a little bit long.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,809
So this is the little trick.

85
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,700
So, um... these are the four topics we'll have today

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
So we have great speakers to introduce us arts,

87
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,220
livestyle and Earth, travel, and finally dreams.

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,800
So, this is your first Ignite talk tonight,

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,509
and now it's your turn to come up the stage and enlighten us.

90
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,079
and remember we all have to have fun tonight.

91
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:12,800
Thank you!
