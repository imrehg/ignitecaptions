00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,500
Good evening everyone, my name is Shanni B,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm an English teacher by day,
a Chinese student by afternoon,

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,700
but I'm also something like Clark Kent, I have an alterego.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
At night I become FireFaye,

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,798
professional fire spinner,
fire eater and fire breather.

6
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,700
So you may think I'm a dragon,
or you may think I'm insane,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,500
but today I hope you'll think about a question:

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,900
can art turn the world on its head?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Now, my medium of choice is flame artistry,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,460
which has accrued something of a bad name in Taiwan.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,400
So before I convince you that fire dance
can be used for a greater good

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,460
I need to dispell a few myths.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,200
If you are a new arrival in this country,

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,500
you may not be familiar with the recent accident in Taichung.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,090
In March of this year, a dancer was performing
a fire show at the AHA nightclub

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,419
Mid-set he threw a sparkler at the ceiling

17
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,000
which caught the styrofoam soundproofing on fire,

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,900
and engulfed the entire building
in a devastating three minutes.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now the public has long been misinformed about fire dance

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,089
and like so many things, they were able to take
an isolated, headline-grabbing incident

21
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:12,970
as proof for their long held misconceptions.

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,600
I don't you to think for a second,
that I'm downplaying this catastrophe

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,000
I speak for the firespinning community as a whole
when I say it broke our hearts.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,600
But one million people die from vehicular accidents every year.

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,730
Does this necessitate a blanket ban on driving?

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,600
Certainly not. If we are sobering aware,
roads can be made safer.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,900
The dancer in question that night was
very new to fire dance.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
He had no business performing a public show
with his lack of experience.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,202
Furthermore, the bar itself had previously
been shut down for failing a safety inspection

30
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:52,000
Not even the most esteemed dancer
in the world could have performed there.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,900
Fire dance is actually quite safe provided
you respect what you're doing

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,920
and follow well established safety guidelines,
which I don't have time to outline here.

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,040
So if any of these photos have inspired you
to stick flaming objects down your mouth,

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,700
please, talk to me first.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Well, time is short, so hopefully by now
I have you at least semi-convinced,

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,819
fire dance is not an inherently dangerous and sadistic activity.

37
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,000
Assuming this premise,
I digress back to my original question:

38
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,889
"Can art turn the world on its head?"

39
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:28,500
and i hope to convince you in the remaining
two minutes that the answer is yes.

40
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,559
In addition to flame arts, I studied ecology
and I'm something of a tree hugger.

41
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,200
So one day I got to thinking:

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,909
How can fire dance be used to contribute
towards solutions to ecological problems?

43
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,479
To make a long story short here's some things we've done.

44
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:51,629
One of my tropes for shows was a benefit
for critically endangered Taiwan sousa dolphins.

45
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,700
In addition to raising forty-five hundred dollars for this cause

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,700
we raised awareness by distributing literature and

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,028
giving short talks on habitat degradation between sets.

48
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,909
And a few months ago I performed on a
Taiwanese television show

49
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,940
I used the opportunity to introduce a
local NGO, The Society of Wilderness,

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,000
and when I won a ten thousand NTD prize,
I donated it to this organization.

51
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,109
So by now you are probably thinking,

52
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,900
"Sure, Shanni, you are well intentioned, but 500 US?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,200
That is a ripple in an ocean, when
measured agains the five hundred million,

54
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,740
Big Oil spends on lobby every year.

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
You're not gonna save the world this way, wake up."

56
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,680
And I'll tell you, you're right, I'm not,

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,809
and that is precisely why I've come here today:

58
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:43,499
to convince all of you to join me.

59
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,888
Because what if everyone who'd every said:

60
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:52,359
"I'd love to help, but what can I do?
The problems are so big and I'm so small."

61
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,683
dared to try?

62
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:57,300
Our ripples could become a tidal wave.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,119
And maybe now you tell me,
"well, I see the logic, but fire freaks me out, man!"

64
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,829
and I'd say, that's okay. Art comes in many forms.

65
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,907
My topic today was inspired by photographer JR,

66
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:13,966
who pasted giant pictures of Palestinians
and Israelis on the Gaza security strip

67
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,639
to get these warring nations each other as more than enemies.

68
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,339
And one of my personal heroes, John Lennon
inspired generations with the simple words:

69
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,560
Give peace a chance.

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,000
Maybe now you'll tell me: "well I'm no iconic rock star"

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,720
and I say it again, that matters not.

72
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,699
The global problems we face today are magnificent in scale.

73
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,619
Any solution we find will be multi-stakeholder.

74
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,262
Everyone in this room is good at something.

75
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,200
Maybe you're surfer, you're a wave artist.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,809
Maybe you have a talent with worlds, you're language artist

77
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,690
Maybe you're good at math, for what greater prose exists
than the poetry of nature expressed through numbers.

78
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,940
But maybe you're just a sandwich artist working at Subway.

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,709
Whatever it is you do can be used
for something greater than itself.

80
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:05,679
All it takes is a little creativity, and a little more drive.

81
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,739
Thank you. No go turn the world on its head.
