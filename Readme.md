# Ignite captions

Captions for Ignite talk videos. Mostly by [Ignite Taipei][ignitetaipei],
but other ones as well, if we need subtitles for them.

Aiming to have every talk with at least Englis+Chinese subtitles. Once
we have English, it is easier to translate it into any other language
as well.

For English language talks, start with Youtube's auto-transcribing service;
For Chinese language talks, all has to be done manually
