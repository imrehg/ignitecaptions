00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Hello everybody, Andrew Hyde with Ignite Boulder,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,200
wanted to welcome you to this week show

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,200
and also introduce Scott Berkun from Ignite Seattle

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,550
talking about how to give an Ignite presentation.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,650
It's fantastic.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,200
If you haven't given an Ignite presentation
this is your inspiration to do it.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,650
If you have, this is how to get better. Enjoy!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ignite is an ongoing series of speedy presentations.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,100
They range from building multi-person pogo sticks
to hacking chocolate.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
Any topic the geeks hold dear.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,700
Each speaker gets only five minutes,

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
and twenty slides that auto-advance every fifteen seconds.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,400
The talk you are about to hear was recorded live

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
at one of the featured Ignite events around the world.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,300
I think storytelling is everything.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,700
It is everything!

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,780
It's the most important thing that we do,
it's the most important thing that we are.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,500
And if you go about thinking about life
in the perspective that storytelling is everything

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,300
then doing things like public speaking or writing or talking

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,900
or starting a relationship all become a lot simpler.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,100
Storytelling happens to be a universal thing, it is a timeless thing,

22
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,000
it's something we have done as long as we have been a species,

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,740
as long as we've been cultures and tribes and governments

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,930
we've been storytellers.

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,150
And in effect we align ourselves,
the people we bond with, we have shared stories,

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,550
that we often tell again and again with each other.

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,600
So storytelling is something we all do all the time,
and we are all good at it.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Any community you're in, any club you join,

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,600
any team you root for, there's a set of stories you all share.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,500
So when it comes to doing an Ignite talk,
you guys already have stories

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,300
and you are already good at telling them,
because that's why you are alive.

32
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,400
Now, when it comes to doing a talk like this, do in this format

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,400
you have to be a little bit more concise
in the kinds of stories you tell.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,450
There's three piles of stories to think about.

35
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,830
The first is what you love, what gets you excited.

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,600
Now I know for a fact that all of you
did not commit suicide today. You're here.

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Why?

38
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,389
What is it that gets you up in the morning,
what gets you going?

39
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,400
On the other end the spectrum there's what you hate,
what makes you angry.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,360
What would you remove from the world if you could?

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,209
Also a place for passion!

42
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,000
You can be passionate about what you hate.

43
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,000
Because in fact if you think about enough of
what you hate and flip it over

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,099
you probably have something you should be loving more.

45
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,800
It's a trick involved what you love and what you hate.

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
The third pile of stuff is what you good at.

47
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,400
What have you been doing for five years or ten years

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
and you finally have some kind of insight

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,119
that you wish someone have told you when you started.

50
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,200
That's money, that so powerful,

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,500
that's the most important powerful kinda story
you can tell in a crazy format like this.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
And if you have none of these three things,

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,190
then your job is a metastory.

54
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,660
You need to do things outside of this format
that will give you opportunities to tell stories about.

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,620
And if you fail that, then you get a metastory

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,400
about the story how you tried to find
a story to tell but you failed.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
That's also a story.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
Now.

59
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,800
When it comes to this format people get freaked out about

60
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
"i got to tell my story up on stage"

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,300
and now there's a whole of dynamic of public speaking

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,300
What you should know, there's lots of famous public speakers
that are actually lousy speakers.

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,210
People like Cicero, Moses, and this guy, Lincoln.

64
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,700
They're probably actually not very pleasant to listen to.

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Its stutters, high-pitched voices,

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,200
but what they said was interesting,
they told stories that they refined

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,229
they made really clear where their points were.

68
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,599
so people paid more attention of the ideas
and how it's actually said,

69
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,919
which is true today.

70
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,700
And in fact, in fact the other thing be worry
about is the time limit.

71
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,709
The Gettysburg Address is only about two minutes long to read.

72
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,079
You could do two Gettysburg Addresses in one Ignite.

73
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,150
So you have no worries about how long...
"Yo, I cannot fit into..." Yes you can, you can fit it in.

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,400
Now the other fear people have has to do with the fact
that the slides move on their own.

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,600
There's this Grim Reaper looming overhead,

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,400
and every moment it's gonna come like a Terminator
it's gonna knock me into the next thing.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,079
People are terrified about this.

78
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,709
I happen to think it's kind of funny.

79
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,109
I think it's kind of funny in the same way
we worry about things that we can't control.

80
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,309
You have two choices for things you can't control.

81
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,830
You can be paranoid about them, deny them, 
or you can revel in them.

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,200
And i think it's a perfect format, 
you guys know know it's coming,

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,559
it's part of the entertainment.

84
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,100
They're all gonna expect to have happen,

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
and we can make it a joyful experience coming from it, right?

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
You guys gonna support me if I screw up this slide?

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,569
Right? You guys are with me? Right, thank you, alright.

88
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,000
So Ignite audiences happens to be some of
the best audience to speak to

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,489
'coz you guys are on my side. You might be
drunk and that may help a little bit,

90
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,000
but you're on my side, you'll back me
if I make a mistake.

91
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,360
So if you wanna try out public speaking
you gonna get good, positive audiences in this environment.

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,199
Now the last thing, this is the more practical portion of
my five minutes: how to use time.

93
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,819
It's a philosophical question, but a
practical question for these five minutes.

94
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,050
You only have time to say four or five things,

95
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,999
so, you'll wanna be really careful what they are.

96
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,169
You can't fit that much more into five minutes.

97
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,700
So think about that before you get started.

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
The second thing is that you'll gonna lose your
first slide and your last slide.

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,999
Due to applause, people throwing things at you,

100
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,100
your introduction, you gonna blow those.

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,749
So you gonna practice and plan for having
less time than even the twenty slides that you get.

102
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,699
Now the last thing is a little trickier.

103
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,400
People's get up here and they go into full-speed mode,
they're talking like auctioneers on crack.

104
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,300
Going really fast.
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
So look into the upper right hand corner of this slide.

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,900
In a second you'll see a little mark appear,
a little cigarett burn mark

107
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,509
I've now have put the same image
on two consecutive slides.

108
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,200
This is a legal, it is allowed.

109
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,349
You can hack the format as much as you want.

110
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,529
A slide is a....

111
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,400
We don't use slides anymore, the whole notion
of slides is a kind of ridiculous,

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,230
So hack it to tell your story.

113
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,560
The last thing:

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,979
if you are working with four, five minutes of time
you can rehearse and practice ten times in an hour.

115
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,600
Now I recommend you do it at least once
before you make any slides at all.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,100
Just so that you can figure out what your points are,
what you wanna say.

117
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,960
And as you practice you build the material
and back fill it in.

118
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,700
So to sum up, all of you have a story to tell,
and you are good at it.

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Second, don't worry about the Grim Reaper,
you can hack around that.

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,700
And third, practice is everything.

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,799
And I hope to see you guys, up here, next time.
Thank you.
